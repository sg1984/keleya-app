Keleya App

## Getting Started

After cloning the project and opening in your favourite IDE, please check the `lib/servces/api.dart` file to confirm that the variable `SERVER_URL` has the same address as the Keleya Server application, otherwhise things might get ugly. Not that ugly, the app won't be able to connect with the server because they are in different address, but you get the idea, right?

If you see any problem, please reach out so I can fix it ASAP.

Thanks!
