Keleya App

## Getting Started

After cloning the project and opening in your favourite IDE: 
* Please check the `lib/servces/api.dart` file to confirm that the variable `SERVER_URL` has the same address as the Keleya Server application, otherwhise things might get ugly. Not that ugly, the app won't be able to connect with the server because they are in different address, but you get the idea, right?

* Select one device from the list in your IDE, I selected Chrome to build this and "it worked on my machine" (EVER, Every Developer);
* Run the app and play with it. Just remember that the server app should be running at the same time, OK?

If you see any problem, please reach out so I can fix it ASAP.

Thanks!
